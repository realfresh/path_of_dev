There are two ways to install the SDK.

 ### Install via NPM

Installing the SDK via NPM is our recommend method. To install it use either of the following shell commands. The NPM package also includes TypeScript definitions.

```bash
npm install --save @ezauth/client
# OR
yarn add @ezauth/client
```

### Install via CDN

A minified version of the SDK can be loaded directly via a CDN. This is perfectly fine to use for websites. Include the following script in your HTML before using ezAuth in any code.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.fastly.com/bundle/umd.js"></script>
```

### Initialize client-side

Once you have installed the SDK, the next step is to initialize it.

```javascript
import EzAuth from "@ezauth/client" // ONLY FOR NPM INSTALL

const auth = new EzAuth({
  clientKey: "...",
});
```

### Initialize server-side

When initializing the SDK server-side, we can also include our secret key which is used to validate our authentication tokens. 

```javascript
import EzAuth from "@ezauth/client"

const auth = new EzAuth({
  secretKey: "...",
  clientKey: "...",
});
```

At this point, you are ready to start using ezAuth.
