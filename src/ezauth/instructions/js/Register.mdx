Creating a new user in the system is a simple process. There are 3 unique identifiers that a user account can be created with. They are:

- Username
- E-mail
- Password

### Creating an account with a single identifier

A user account can be created with just one identifier or all 3. To create a new user account, we simply need to do the following.

```js
await auth.register({
  email: "example@test.com"
  password: "123123",
})
```

### Create an account with multiple identifiers

```js
await auth.register({
  username: "example",
  email: "example@test.com"
  phone: "+6143 3910 335",
  password: "123123",
})
```

### Create an account without a password

Accounts created without a password must use the code login strategy. This means a temporary login code will be sent to the user via e-mail or phone. As such, cannot use a `username` only. An e-mail or phone must be supplied.

```js
await auth.register({
  email: "example@test.com"
})
```

### Create an account with custom data

Every user can have their own profile object contains custom data about the user. This is perfect to store a users role or permissions.

```js
await auth.register({
  email: "example@test.com",
  password: "123123,
  profile: {
    role: "admin",
  }
})
```
